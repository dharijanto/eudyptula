## Motivation Behind Learning Linux Kernel

I've always been curious about Linux kernel inner working.
Considering the billions of different devices out there leveraging on Linux
kernel to operate, it's just really fascinating to me how a single code base
could possibly cater for them all. I also want to be able to make contributions through
my passion in software engineering and be sure that the contribution
is really practical for people, and considering sheer amount of Linux users, Linux
kernel seems like a sensical choice.

Anybody who wants to be a better programmer would also benefit
from having a deep understanding about an operating system. For example, a user-space
programmer coding in high-level language such as Javascript would be able to write
more efficient code when he is able to make educated assumption about how the OS
would ultimately execute their code.
Last but not least, Linux kernel is the single largest open source project with
the highest number of distributed contributors. To be able to become one of those
contributors would definitely help one to become a better team-player.

## Challenges

Having said that, I've been trying to learn Linux kernel for quite some time.
My first attempt was to just jump into its code base, but it proven to be too
daunting. The code base is so large and contains so many components
and require deep knowledge about how low-level system works (i.e. bootloader),
making it very challenging to understand by just reading it.
I searched around forums to go about learning Linux kernel, and found out people recommending
books, online readings, etc. They are all awesome, but for me it's just really boring
to focus merely on theory without practice.

I am a big believer that the best way to get into something
is by getting one's hands wet. Which means instead of learning the theory
and then put it in practice, it's the other way around. First I'd figure out
the concrete goal I want to accomplish, and then works backward to learn
the theory needed to do it.

After lots of searching, I finally found out Eudyptula Challenge, which
is a coding-oriented challenges whose goal is to each its participants
to learn Linux kernel. Its website is already closed for new participants,
but fortunately there were some good people out there who posted the challanges
and theri questions to the challenges up for free on GitHub, such as
Vitaly Osipov [https://github.com/agelastic/eudyptula]

Since people say that the best way to learn something is by teaching it, I'm
going one step further by attempting to post a theory and explanation behind each
of the challenges. The explanations would be found on each of the challenges
individual folders.
